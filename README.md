Hello! My name is Alvin Tu. I'm an iOS developer from New York. I don't like to run often, but I do like to play basketball for some light cardio. I also enjoy seeing the similarities and differences in cultures through cooking.  

Always growing as an iOS developer, but also interested in branching out to different technologies to grow into a well-rounded software engineer.

Currently exploring the power of:  
Metal, SwiftUI, and Combine in iOS  
&
nodeJS, fastapi, & Flask in back-end tech
&  
the dreadful leetcode algos
